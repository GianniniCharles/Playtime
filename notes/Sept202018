Yesterday I was hired by Ocean Reef Club to work as a developer! I'm so excited to work with their AWESOME team! For those who have observed my Github to this point, I will be shifting the primary focus of my programming studies from JS over to whatever languages my new client needs
It's time to take my code to the next level.
