WordPress.org vs WordPress.com



WordPress is opensource software.
	- An entire organization is founded to oversee WordPress.
		○ It's free to take it, use it, sell it, and even make it your own.
		○ WordPress.org is the foundation behind Wordpress. 
			§ Let mostly by Mat Mohonway, wordpress.
WordPress.com isn't as much opensource.
	- Free to use and is limited.


Wordpress.com has a cleaner dashboard than .org
	- But it actually uses the calypso interface. It comes with different kindss of rest API and JavaScript in WordPress.
	- Wordpress calpyso uses JS, Node, React


Go daddy and bluehost set it all up for you. Ready to go as soon as you pay them the money.

Wordcamp: Hosting half the price forever.
	- Go daddy doesn't perform chat/email support. Call only.
	- Chat is a better feature.
	- Gotta work with cwha


Hosting:
Whichever one the client is most comfortable with.
	- BlueHost
	- WPEngine
	- GoDaddy (sucky customer service and callback but cheap)


Calypso package for WordPress is also open source.
Gutenberg is also open source.


- Security: Websites are very very vulnerable. Server has a portnumber and you tell it who to let access to. Internet stuff, anyone can come onto server.
	- Little firewall needs to be set to stop crazy. You need to make sure you have a server.
	- Wordfence is important plugin.
	- Limit login attacks.
	- JetPack does SEO and Security.
	- Wordpress also gives updates.
	- Wordpress managed hosting provides extra security, or you can do daily backups.
	- Manage wp  month does 30 days worth of backups.

	Guy has some things. Some wp sites on AWS and VPS. Be aware and set things up. No major issues.
	
	
	For hashing, you can do md - 5 and makes the hash. It's encrypted. Ppl who are hacking. Just have difficult passwords.
	
	-Hash passwords and save it, google lock, something to make it.
	
	- If they're in the database.
	- PHP does encryption with md5. Once in the database, assume data is vulnerable.

	- Calypso wants to get away from SQL and use rest API's.
	- Install wordfence (20 min install).
	- Use Child Themes for you thing to not overdo.
	- (WordPress.com)When using themes
